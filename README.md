# with-auth0 project

This project is designed to help you learn how to implement authentication using Auth0 in a Next.js application. It follows the steps outlined in the book **Real World Next.js** by **Michele Riva**, which walks you through the process of integrating authentication in a Next.js application using Auth0.

## üöÄ Features

- **Auth0 Authentication**: Secure your application with Auth0 by handling user login and registration.
- **Next.js**: Build a modern, fast, and SEO-friendly web application using Next.js.
- **Real World Application**: Follow the guidance of the Real World Next.js book and learn how to implement authentication.
- **Learn Auth0**: Understand how to integrate third-party authentication systems (like Auth0) into your app.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building fast, static, and dynamic web applications.
- **Auth0**: An authentication and authorization platform that helps you secure applications.
- **React**: The JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Server-side code to handle authentication.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
